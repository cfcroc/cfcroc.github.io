Hey! We are Chelsea FC Official Supporters Club based in Rochester, NY, USA. We meet every week for Premier League games at the [Twisted Tap](https://www.twistedtaproc.com) located on East Ave. Come join us for the upcoming London Derby as we bounce back from last week's loss and take on West Ham at the Bridge.
